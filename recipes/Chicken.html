    <h2>Description:</h2> 

    <p>This simple and flavorful chicken breast recipe combines tender, juicy chicken with a delicious herb-infused marinade of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, thyme, and Dijon mustard. The chicken is seasoned and allowed to marinate for a bit, ensuring every bite is packed with savory goodness. It’s then seared in a hot skillet until golden and crisp on the outside while remaining juicy on the inside. A splash of white wine or chicken broth is added to create a rich sauce that enhances the flavors, while a sprinkle of fresh parsley adds a burst of color. Serve it with roasted vegetables, quinoa, or a light salad for a quick and satisfying meal that’s both healthy and full of flavor.</p>
